<!-- # DLT4BPM 2025 -->

# Aim and scope

The DLT4BPM workshop is a platform to present research on and applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), with a dedicated submission type to support interactive on-site discussions.

DLT systems open diverse opportunities in Business Process Management (BPM) in a wide range of industries. However, these opportunities come with challenges related to security, privacy, scalability, and performance.

Academia and practice address those challenges from several angles: Conceptual modeling for DLT and BPM; Collaborative business process execution on DLT; Process monitoring and auditing on data stored by distributed ledgers; Secrecy-preserving data sharing among actors in a multi-party process setting; The use of process mining to analyze and validate smart contracts; and many more. 

As an outlet at the intersection of DLTs and BPM, the DLT4BPM workshop welcomes contributions of conceptual, technical, and application-oriented nature from students, researchers, and industry practitioners alike. We encourage submissions relevant to enterprises, governmental bodies, and other organizational forms across diverse domains — such as healthcare, education, finance, logistics, and others.

Topics relevant to the workshop include, but are not limited to:  

**Foundations**
* Formal verification of DLT-based processes
* Conceptual modeling for DLT and BPM
* Domain-specific modeling languages for DLT and BPM
* Taxonomies, ontologies, and design patterns for DLT and BPM
* Identification of novel problems and  research gaps
* Vision papers on the future of DLT and BPM

**Engineering**
* Design of DLT-based process-aware information systems (PaIS)
* Model-driven engineering solutions for DLT and BPM
* Automatic code generation for DLT systems supporting BPM
* Requirement engineering for DLT and BPM
* On-chain and off-chain process execution and enactment
* Scalable models for DLT-based process execution
* Interoperability and cross-chain processes 
* Oracles, off-chain, and cross-chain information exchange for decision support
* Distributed process monitoring, predictive models, and anomaly detection
* Distributed compliance monitoring and auditing
* On-chain and off-chain data analytics and process mining
* Self-sovereign identity solutions for DLT and BPM
* Security and resilience requirements for DLT
* Privacy, confidentiality, and access control for DLT-based solutions
* Zero-knowledge proof techniques for process execution
* LLM and ML for BPM on DLT

**Management**
* Organizational and governance models for DLT and BPM
* Enforcement of regulations and business rules with DLTs
* Empirical case studies on the usage of DLTs in BPM
* Experience report on the use & adoption of DLTs in businesses
* Authentication and identity management in DLT and BPM
* Data provenance and management in DLT and BPM
* Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, KYC, AML) and legal aspects of DLT-based PaIS
* Economic and environmental sustainability of DLT-based PaIS
* Vertical applications of DLT-based PaIS (e.g., healthcare, supply chain, finance, logistics)


# Submissions
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers and abstracts within the workshop’s topics. Submissions must be written in English and cannot be simultaneously submitted to other journals or conferences. Submission types:
1. Full Research Papers: Full papers should provide comprehensive coverage of the research topic, including objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. The maximum length is 15 pages, including figures, tables, references, etc.
2. Research-in-Progress Abstracts (not included in the proceedings): We invite short abstracts (maximum 2 pages) on ongoing work, providing a high-level overview of emerging ideas, preliminary findings, or innovative concepts in DLT and BPM. Selected abstracts will be presented as lightning talks to spark discussion and engagement in the interactive session.

Submissions must be prepared according to the format of Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing ([LNBIP](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)) specified by Springer. The title page must contain a short abstract and a list of keywords, preferably inspired by the list of topics above. Papers must be submitted electronically via EasyChair.
